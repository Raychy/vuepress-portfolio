**“if you really believe in what you’re doing work, take nothing personally and if something blocks one route find another. Never give up” –Lauren Notaro.**

I am sharing my journey on how I started as a computer science student. 


##  Why did I choose computer science?

During my secondary school days, I wasn’t exposed to programing, coding and all that like it’s evolved now. But after I finished my ssce I went to greet my uncle and I met his friend who happened to be a programmer. Hmmm… he is always on laptop 24/7 and I kept wondering what he always does on the laptop. How novice of me I don’t even know how to on a laptop not to talk of doing stuffs on it. So funny…But one day I asked my uncle’s friend what he does always on the laptop? What is it all about?

So he explained to me that he’s into programing (Java to be precise) and that he works for company. What is programming? (that was my question). Then he gave his explanations which convinced me of wanting to go into it. And he told me that if I really want to do it, it is best I go for computer science that it will help me a lot it. 

I planned on going to technology university rather than any university or polytechnic. I choose Federal University of Technology, Akure and sat for their examination but I wasn’t given admission. I decided to apply to Federal polytechnic, ilaro and fortunately for me I was given admission. My journey started in federal polytechnic, Ilaro, I’m still in the journey though because I’m still a student there.
