### My Experience In Federal Polytechnic Ilaro

Federal polytechnic, Ilaro opened me to a lot of things. The first project I would do is Hospital management system using visual basic, which was during my ND. But later I fell in love with frontend development. Actually one of my lecturer made to, then he gave us a project to work on (we were offering introduction to internet as a course then) and I was able to work on that project and other people’s project. I was opportune to join a programmer’s club which is PROGRAMMERS’ HUB and the club has impact me in multiple ways.
