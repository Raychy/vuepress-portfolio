# The Software Engineering approach in Cross-Platform Programming with Flutter (Part 3)

Designing and developing the Flutter application data models and backend using the Build value and Bloc pattern.

This part continues the previous part. If you haven’t read from the first part, go to this link, or if you haven’t read the second part, go to this link, then come back here.

# The Gallery Models
We need to be able to use the models as an immutable object and easy to serialize and deserialize them. Using an immutable object has many advantages. So I’m going to use the build_value package to do so. You can take a look at this article to learn more about that.

To build your application models, you have to take a look at the class diagram that I talked about before. Before building the models, the application class diagram should be verified by your backend team.

Let’s see the gallery models. I hope you opened the first part and checking the class diagram. Some of them are obvious, like Account, Authentication, Gallery, GalleryQuery, Media, MediaType, and Album.
